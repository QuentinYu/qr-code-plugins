== How to read QR Code ==
There are plenty of QR Code readers on the market. Please check
the marketplace according to your platform (iPhone, Android, etc.)


== Notes ==
* Tested with Google SketchUp 8
* Uses web service to generate a QR Code so the plug-in requires internet connection.
* Close the Outliner before generating QR Code. This technique will generate QR Code faster since the Outliner does not flicker.
* Make QR Code blocks black or very dark and keep the background white or light so the code is readable.
* It may take some time to generate QR Code so please be patient.
